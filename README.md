# ~ Network Scanner
An Advanced and versatile tool who scans through your network, and find devices and gives an extensive information about that.

At the initial stage I am focusing upon a CLI based application tool, later will think to build GUI.

## Workflows Todo ðŸ¤ž

- [ ] Scans all devices over network.
- [ ] Detect what type of device is it.
- [ ] Also check which ports are open.
- [ ] Device information
- [ ] Extensive information like which software are installed on that machines

## Technology Used ðŸ”¥

Currently I have not yet figure it out how will I build the idea into production ready application.

Just a thought - Python / GO will be a better choice or the other.
